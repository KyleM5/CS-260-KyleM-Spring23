 - Introduce yourself on Discord []
 - Create a readme file with five topics related to computing that interests me and five topics I feel are difficult right now. []

 I won't be introducing myself on Discord as I would feel really uncomfortable to do that right now

 Five topics related to computing that interests me:
 
 Artificial intelligence is kinda neat. I watch this person called Code Bullet on YouTube, and he does some stuff with machine learning, with a video that I watched being training an AI to beat Jump King
 
 Raytracing is cool for gaming. Unfortunately, my graphics card doesn't support it.
 
 Human interfaces are pretty important to me, otherwise it would be hard to type
 
 Coding is also an interest of mine, though not very heavily one. I've programmed Python and touched on JavaScript before.
 
 Syntax would be the last one. Learning the proper way would be neat.

Five topics that I find difficult right now:
 
 C++. I haven't programmed in C++ before, so I will be using online resources to learn C++. (And I need to learn it quickly)

 Data structures... Hopefully it becomes a little less hard

 Machine learning. I have very little interest to learn about it and it seems like a pain

 Operating systems. I hope that I don't have to touch that

 Linux. I tried it for a few weeks and I don't know much about it. I will probably change this laptop from Windows to Linux in the future (once the class is over) because while on Linux this device had zero issues with the touch screen, but I now it shuts off if the screen has been on for a few minutes.
