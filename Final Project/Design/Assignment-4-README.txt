Assignment 4: Arbitrary list operations.
I chose this one out of the three as I feel like I could do something neat with it.

Create a linked-list that allows:
 - An add function that takes a value and inserts it into a given position into the list

 - A remove function that takes a position and removes the value stored at that position of the list and returns it

 - A get function that takes a position and returns you the value without removing it

Be  sure to include at least 1 test function for each piece of functionality that should verify that the code is working.

To test the add function as well as the get function. Test getting data from a position twice. Both times should be the same. Afterwards add a value to that position and used the get function again. The new value should be the added value. We can then use the remove function and see the get return the original value.
