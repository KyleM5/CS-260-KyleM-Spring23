Final Assignment: graph
 - Create a design before you start coding the describes or shows how a graph structure could be used to store some kinds of data and attempts to solve some kind of problem.

 - Create some tests (at least two for each peice of functionality) before you start coding

 - Implement a graph class wth at least (this category effectively combines implementation and specification, partly to emphasize getting the algoriths working!):
  - A function to add a new vertex to the graph (perhaps add_vertex(vertex_name))
  - A function to add a new edge between two vertices of the graph (perhaps add_edge(source, destination), or source.add_edge(destination))
  - A function for a shortest path algorithm (perhaps shortest_path(source, destination))
  - A function for a minimum spanning tree algorithm (example min_span_tree()).

Analyze the complexity of all of your graph behaviors (effectively part of our documentation for grading purposes)

Oce you have completed and tested the code, add to the README file what line(s) of codes or inputs and outputs show your work meeting each of the above requirements.

A graph can be used to show how things connect together. An example of a graph could be in the form of a game map, where it shows you how a location is connected to another location. Another use of a graph is a
