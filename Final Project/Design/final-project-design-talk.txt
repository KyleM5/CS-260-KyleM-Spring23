Goal for the project: Make a graph while meeting the requirement for the other projects

Other Projects:
 - Assignment 0: Introduction to myself with some stuff about meeting
 - Assignment 1: Make a bag of marbles
 - Assignment 2: Create design for a queue and a linked list
 
 Note: Assignment 3-5 all count for the same points. Only 1 is needed
 - Assignment 3: Design and implement a Queue data structure and analyze the complexity of the implementation
 - Assignment 4: Create a linked-list which you can add, remove, and read from a given spot in the list and test each piece of functionality
 - Assignment 5: Make an auto-sorting list

For all of these assignment, you cannot use the vector library. For later assignments that is fine, but not for these ones.
